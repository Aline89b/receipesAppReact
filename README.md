## About The Project

![Look for your favourite vegetarian receipe!](./src/vegReceipeScreen.png)

This is my third project for s2i platform. Here I've used React library creating a small app for vegetarian people.
It is possible to make a research of vegetarian receipes by typing the ingredient in the search bar.
You will see a list of receipes got from [Spoonacular Api](https://spoonacular.com/). Then, clicking on the result you go straight to the page where you can find ingredients and instruction for cooking.


## Using Receipes App

To use the Receipes App, follow these steps:

```
press inside the search bar
type the name of the ingredient you looking for
press the button search to check if there are receipes with the ingredient you want
click on the result and read ingredients and instructions 

```
You can find the app deployed on github pages at the address https://aline89b.github.io/receipesAppReact/.
